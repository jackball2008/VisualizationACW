Object Description:
Input object is a Group which contains 2 members.
 member 0 is named CT
 member 1 is named SP
Each group member is a Field, the basic data carrying structure in DX.
The positions are enclosed within the box defined by the corner points:
[ 0 0 0 ] and [ 71 81 0 ]
Data range is:
Begin Execution
minimum = 0, maximum = 557, average = 92.9236
(These are the scalar statistics which will be used by modules
which need scalar values.  The length is computed for vectors and
the determinant for matricies.)
Input is not ready to be rendered because 2 Fields in the Input object do not have colors yet.
Use the `AutoColor', `AutoGreyScale', or `Color' modules to add colors.
