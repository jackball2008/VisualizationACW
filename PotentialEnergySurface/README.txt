3.1 Potential energy surface
Read the 2D regular grid of scalar values in file potenh3.data. The dependent variable data
represent heights (z) of the potential energy surface (PES) of the chemical reaction
H + H2 â†” H2 + H, where H is a hydrogen atom and H2 a hydrogen molecule. The low-energy
channels parallel to the x and y axes are the routes along which the H atoms approach and retreat
from the H2 molecule. Since this is a PES, if there is a local minimum1 at the intersection of these
low-energy channels it means a stable H3 entity can form during the reaction.
Use visualization to show the overall variation of the PES above and below the horizontal plane,
and demonstrate whether or not three H atoms could form a stable entity. What approach best
allows the viewer to obtain a value for the local minimum, if one exists, and its position?
